# WD-CaseStudy

I'm going to design a personal website.

The website's purpose is to engage people to interact with one another in whatever their hobby is. If they have the same hobbies, they can talk to each other about what they like about it or why they like it. My targeted audience is specifically teenagers who don't have friends or people who want somebody to talk to. 

Three general goals for my website are: 
1. Creating a safe environment for people to hang out and talk to each other
2. Try to interact with the people myself in case if they have questions or want to talk
3. Make sure that everyone is comfortable and feels safe enough to be there 

  The elements I might put into this to make it more enjoyable are: 
Having animators put animations on the home page of the website to help catch peoples' attention 
Having artists put their art on the home page if they feel comfortable enough
Removing any person that makes a problem for anybody or everybody else 

The elements I would use to make it seem that my website is current are updating it regularly, putting the year on the bottom of the page 

Connectivity tools I will use to encourage others to share my content are putting ads to promote 

Creating something that lets people to talk to each other. Like a chat room or just on the website where you can either comment or private message. They could share ideas or share projects that they're working on. Using social media to engage with people would be another option. 

My tagline would be "Aaahh hobby" since it's a website about hobbies
