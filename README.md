CASE STUDY 1
I'm going to design a personal website.

The website's purpose is to engage people to interact with one another in whatever their hobby is or just looking for someone to talk to. If they have the same hobbies, they can talk to each other about what they like about it or why they like it. My targeted audience is specifically teenagers who don't have friends or people who want somebody to talk to. Ages 17-40 is what I'm typically going for. People that have trouble making money could ask others to give advice for making more money, depressed people could talk to others about their problems to see if they could tone down the problem and make it better for themselves,people that deal with anxiety on a daily basis could talk to others to see if they could get rid of the problem completely or if they could make the problem better so it's not as bad, people with mental or physical diseases could try to find others just like them and talk about how each of them are personally feeling.  

Three general goals for my website are: 
1. Creating a safe environment for people to hang out and talk to each other, making sure people don't feel judged for whatever reason they're there. 
2. Try to interact with the people myself in case if they have questions or want to talk, or if they're having problems with the website or a specific person
3. Make sure that everyone is comfortable and feels safe enough to be there, try to find hackers or spammers and get rid of them. Have people talk to me about a person that is making them feel uncomfortable or disturbed. 

  The elements I might put into this to make it more enjoyable are: 
Having animators put animations on the home page of the website to help catch peoples' attention 
Having artists put their art on the home page if they feel comfortable enough
Removing any person that makes a problem for anybody or everybody else, including hackers, spammers, or just people that like to bully others

CASE STUDY 2

The elements I would use to make it seem that my website is current are updating it regularly, putting the year on the bottom of the page 

Connectivity tools I will use to encourage others to share my content are putting ads to promote 

Creating something that lets people to talk to each other. Like a chat room or just on the website where you can either comment or private message. They could share ideas or share projects that they're working on. Using social media to engage with people would be another option. 

My tagline would be "Aaahh hobby" since it's a website about hobbies 

I'm gonna use coloring to attract colors so I would try to make it look attractive enough to stay and look at. I think that either purple, blue, or red would be good.

It would be easier to start with mobile devices rather than computers first. Getting used to how much space it takes for a mobile device and so there isn't too much space. Using a minimizer for mobile and a maximizer for computers and ipads. 

Organizing content would make it easier for people to find what their looking for. Using easy, non-bright colors would make it easier on people who have visual impairments. Making sure my font isn't too big would help a lot because it lets people read easier, plus it doesn't take up as much space.
