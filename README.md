CASE STUDY 1
I'm going to design a personal website.

The website's purpose is to engage people to interact with one another in whatever their hobby is or just looking for someone to talk to. If they have the same hobbies, they can talk to each other about what they like about it or why they like it. My targeted audience is specifically teenagers who don't have friends or people who want somebody to talk to. Ages 17-40 is what I'm typically going for. People that have trouble making money could ask others to give advice for making more money, depressed people could talk to others about their problems to see if they could tone down the problem and make it better for themselves,people that deal with anxiety on a daily basis could talk to others to see if they could get rid of the problem completely or if they could make the problem better so it's not as bad, people with mental or physical diseases could try to find others just like them and talk about how each of them are personally feeling.  

Three general goals for my website are: 
1. Creating a safe environment for people to hang out and talk to each other, making sure people don't feel judged for whatever reason they're there. 
2. Try to interact with the people myself in case if they have questions or want to talk, or if they're having problems with the website or a specific person
3. Make sure that everyone is comfortable and feels safe enough to be there, try to find hackers or spammers and get rid of them. Have people talk to me about a person that is making them feel uncomfortable or disturbed. 

  The elements I might put into this to make it more enjoyable are: 
Having animators put animations on the home page of the website to help catch peoples' attention (getting popular animators to get people to join my website would be good) 
Having artists put their art on the home page if they feel comfortable enough. 
Removing any person that makes a problem for anybody or everybody else, including hackers, spammers, or just people that like to bully others. Cyberbullying has been a really bad problem for a really long time and I won't allow it. 

CASE STUDY 2

The elements I would use to make it seem that my website is current are updating it regularly, putting the year on the bottom of the page. Communicating with the people that are on the website, answering questions that people have about anything, and having people help and support me about removing problematic people or just regular problems. 

Connectivity tools I will use to encourage others to share my content are putting ads to promote, getting other people to share my websites to others, popular people like youtubers, animators, small websites,and bigger websites like amazon, facebook, youtube, etc.    

Creating something that lets people to talk to each other. Like a chat room or just on the website where you can either comment or private message. They could share ideas or share projects that they're working on. Using social media to engage with people would be another option. 

My tagline would be *Aaahh hobby* since it's a website about hobbies. To be honest, I used a tagline generator to create it to give me an idea, but it is original. I didn't steal it, I swear. It gave me multiple choices to choose from (about 20 or more) and this was the one that didn't sound as stupid as the others. 

I'm gonna use coloring to attract colors so I would try to make it look attractive enough to stay and look at. I think that either purple, blue, or red would be good. I'm thinking about using different text colors for different kinds of texts on every page. Each page would have a different text color than the last page. Blue with purple, teal with black, and red with (what does red go good with?)... maybe gold or orange? Those are my text color ideas, hopefully they work out as good as I'm hoping. If I get more pages, I will add more colors for them. *Edit*: *So after starting on Chapter 3, I read through this paragraph and realized that right now, I have 5 pages I plan to have. I will think of colors to add to those pages.*

Inverted pyramid and chunked text: 

It would be easier to start with mobile devices rather than computers first. Getting used to how much space it takes for a mobile device and so there isn't too much space. Using a minimizer for mobile and a maximizer for computers and ipads. Good sizing would make people like the website more, making it easy and manageable would be the best option.  

Organizing content would make it easier for people to find what their looking for. Using easy, non-bright colors (dark colors like black, red, blue (not light!), gray...maybe? Magenta and purple would be good options. Would make it easier on people who have visual impairments. Color blindness would probably be a problem for some people. 

Using colors like yellow, orange, light blue, bright pink, obviously white wouldn't work unless the background was black, maybe gray? Gray could be hard to read sometimes. Bright red might work, depending on how bright you make it. Making sure my font isn't too big would help a lot because it lets people read easier, plus it doesn't take up as much space. Making sure my font size isn't too big would make it easier on people who have to put reading glasses everytime they come across small texts. 

Case Study 3 

My website goals and objectives are to make people feel safe enough to share their ideas and hobbies. People could find someone in their age group that they have similar likes and hobbies. I also have a goal to remove anyone that is a problem for anyone else. If someone is being a problem, the person they're bothering could either block them or report that person to me and I'll figure out what to do with them. 

I'm trying to get around the ages of 17-40 (hopefully nobody 50 and older would join) , for wants that they need, they could talk to me and I could add something that was suggested, I could try to include it to my website. 

I have five pages that I have thought of so far for my website. These pages include: 
1.) The home page which would include information about the website
2.) A page for drawing, animations and stories that people could show off and share with others
3.) A page for chat rooms that people could create, join, or I might create my own chat room that people could come in and ask questions. 
4.) An about us page. This page will contain information on how the website was created, why the website was created, who helped with designing and creating the website, and adding links to people/channels that helped out with the website. (Youtubers, animators, big websites,small websites, etc.) 
5.) A page for contacting the people that helped with the website (hopefully it's not only me) 
I might add more pages later on, but that's all I have for now. I still need to sort out the color deal. *Edit*: *I've made it official that there is not going to be more than five pages*

The website structure I'm using for my website is kind of like the linear style but not going sideways, it goes down. You probably know what I'm talking about but I don't really know how to explain it. I drew it out and organized where I think all my pages should go. 

Case Study 4

Defining my website color scheme: I am using a different pair of colors for every one of my pages. I have a total of 5 pages right now. I'm thinking about teal and black, blue and purple, black and orange, green and orange, green and pink (watermelon colors) 

For testing, it will most likely be me who's testing it. I might have my family try it out and test it, but I'll see what happens when we get there. There is going to be no cost because GitHub lets me create a website for free. I will also be the one who's maintaining and publishing things onto the website. Publishing would also go to the other people who post art and animations in the website. (*Right..?)

The page layout for my homepage and what it's going to look like: There is going to be a search bar at the top right, the website name is going to be near the top left, the tabs that lead to other pages of the website will be where they normally are below the search bar and the website name (not all the way to the bottom), information about my website and describing where everything is located will be in both chunked text and paragraph text.
