Things I need for my website are: 

The first page I would have for my website is the homepage. On the homepage, I would have a paragraph that explains the purpose of the website and what to do on the website.

On the second page, I would want to put animations or drawings that people want to show off. If I can, I would get some popular animators to make some animations for the website. 

On the third page, I would put a list of hobbies that I think people would like. Users could add their own hobbies and everybody could discuss that certain topic they like. It would have a comment-type deal where people would just keep commenting or they could private message is they don't want to just keep commenting.

On the fourth page, I would give people the chance to create chat rooms for people to join. They could have the ability to kick people out or ban people for good.   

Of course, a search bar would be at the top for people to search for certain users, chat rooms, or just a type of hobby that they want to look for.
